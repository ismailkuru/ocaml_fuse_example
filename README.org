* Intro

This implements a directory with a single file "image", backed by file
 /tmp/store. The file appears to be 100M in size.

* Running fuse filesystem, mounting

Run with:

# -f ~ foreground; 1048756 = 2^20, 1M; allow_other ~ needed if run as
# user, but losetup as root

# -o max_write=1048576; /mnt/fuse ~ where we want the mount to appear
./xxx -f -o large_read -o kernel_cache -o big_writes -o splice_write \
-o splice_read -o splice_move -o allow_other   /mnt/fuse

* Mounting image on loopback

sudo losetup /dev/loop5 /mnt/fuse/image


* Make ext filesystem on loop5

sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/loop5

* Mount filesystem

sudo mount /dev/loop5 /mnt/tmp2


* ----------------------------------------
* 2017-03-20 this seems to work with ext4 fs
* make inconsistent assumptions over interface Result (ocamlfuse conflict)
